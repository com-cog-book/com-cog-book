<p>There are three ways to interact with this book:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Static site</strong>: read as a traditional static website.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>In-site interaction</strong>: some sections have a <code>Thebelab</code>  icon at the top of the page.  By clicking the icon, interactive usage will be enabled within the site. Each code-cell will add a <code>run</code> icon at the bottom. If you click the <code>run</code> icon, the cell will request a python kernel to run the contents. This may take a minute.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Remote interaction</strong>: some sections have a <code>Interact via Binder</code> icon at the top of the page.  By clicking the icon, you will be redirected to <a href="https://mybinder.org/">mybinder.org</a>, and interactive cloud computing environment. The site will build the environment with the required dependencies, and launch an interactive Jupyter Notebook. This process usually takes 3-5 minutes to complete the <em>first time</em>. In subsequent attempts, my binder will reuse the environment previously built to speed up the process.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which interactive environment should I use?</strong> Depends on the content of the section. Lightweight code should work just fine <em>In-site</em>. If the section contains a ton of code, you may consider to use the <em>remote binder environment</em>. You can also set up everything in your local environment (i.e., your own computer), by following the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/pabloinsente/comp_models_cog_beh">GitHub repository for the project here</a></p>
