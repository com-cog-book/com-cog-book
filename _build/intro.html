<p>The goal of this project is to introduce a selection of <strong>canonical neural network models of cognition</strong>. Each section covers the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical and theoretical background</li>
<li>Mathematical definition</li>
<li>Code implementation</li>
<li>Example application</li>
<li>Model limitations</li>
</ul>
<p>Models are implemented in Python as Jupyter Notebooks tutorials. Although is recommended to follow the tutorials in a linear fashion, they can be used as stand-alone learning material.</p>
<p>The tutorials are intended to be used by beginner to intermediate level students and/or researchers in cognitive science or related fields, for instance, advance undergraduates or early-stage graduate students. Knowledge of Python is not required, but it is advised to have previous exposure/experience working with some dynamically typed programming language like R, Julia, Scala, or Matlab.</p>
