<p>The goal of this project is to introduce a selection of canonical models in cognitive science. Each section covers the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Historical context  </li>
<li>Theoretical background</li>
<li>Mathematical definition</li>
<li>Code implementation  </li>
<li>Example application  </li>
<li>Model limitations  </li>
</ul>
<p>Models are implemented in Python as Jupyter Notebooks tutorials. Although is recommended to follow the tutorials in a linear fashion, these can be used as stand-alone learning material, which comes at the cost of moderate redundancy in both contents and code.</p>
<p>In the first stage of this project, I focus solely on connectionist models of cognition. In future stages, symbolic and probabilistic models may be added to create a more complete introduction to the subject.</p>
<p>The tutorials are intended to be used by novices to intermediate level students and/or researchers in cognitive science or related fields. Knowledge of Python is not required, but it is advised to have previous exposure/experience working with some dynamic programming language like R, Julia, Scala, or Matlab.</p>
