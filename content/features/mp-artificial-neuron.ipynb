    "Alan Turing's formalization of computation as [Turing Machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNRDvLACg5Q) provided the theoretical and mathematical foundations for modern computer science[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1). Turing Machines are an abstraction of a general computation device. Turing (1937) described these machines as composed by an \"infinite tape\" made of \"cells\" (divided into squares), a \"tape head\", and a table with a finite set of instructions. Each cell contained a symbol, either a 0 or a 1, serving as information storage. The tape head can move along the tape, one cell at the time, to read the cell information. Then, according to a table of instructions at that state and the cell information, the tape head can erase information, write information, or do nothing, to then move to the next cell at the left or the right. In the next cell, the tape head would again do something according to the table of instructions and the cell information, to then repeat the process until the last instruction in the table of instructions. **Figure 1** shows a representation of a Turing machine."

    "The particularities of Turing's description of Turing Machines are not relevant. You can envision a different way to implement the same general computing device. Indeed, alternative models of computation exist, such as \"lambda calculus\" and \"cellular automata\" (Fernández, 2009). The crucial part of Turing's proposal was the articulation of a machine capable to implement *any computable program*. The *computable* part of the last phrase is important because as Turing demonstrated, there are functions that can not be computed, like the [*Entscheidungsproblem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem) (a famous problem in mathematics formulated by [David Hilbert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert) in 1928), one of the problems that motivated Turing's work in the first place. \n",

Among the pioneers were [Warren McCulloch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_McCulloch) and [Walter Pitts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pitts), who in 1943 proposed that biological neurons can be described as computational devices (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943). In a way, this is another iteration to the problem of describing a general-purpose computation device. This time, inspired by how biological neurons work, and with an architecture significantly different than Turing Machines.  \n",

    "Neurons communicate with each other by passing *electro-chemical signals* from the axon terminals in the pre-synaptic neuron to the dendrites in the post-synaptic neuron. Usually, each neuron connects to hundreds or thousands of neurons. For a neuron to \"*fire*\", certain voltage *threshold* must be passed. The *combined excitatory and inhibitory input* received by the post-synaptic neuron from the pre-synaptic neurons determines whether the neuron passes the threshold and fires. Is this *firing* or *spiking* behavior that McCulloch and Pitts modeled computationally. Furthermore, by carefully calibrating the combination of inhibitory and excitatory signals passed to a neuron, McCulloch and Pitts were able to emulate the behavior of a few *boolean functions* or *logical gates*, like the *AND* gate and the *OR* gate. Thinking in this process abstractly, neurons can be seen as biological computational devices, in the sense that they can receive inputs, apply calculations over those inputs algorithmically, and then produce outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main elements of the McCulloch-Pitts model can be summarized as follow:\n",
    "1. Neuron activation is binary. A neuron either fire or not-fire\n",
    "2. For a neuron to fire, the weighted sum of inputs has to be equal or larger than a predefined threshold\n",
    "3. If one or more inputs are inhibitory the neuron will not fire\n",
    "4. It takes a fixed one time step for the signal to pass through a link \n",
    "5. Neither the structure nor the weights change over time\n",

Naturally, they also wanted to abstract away most details and keep what they thought were the *fundamentals elements* to represent computation in biological neurons. Next, we will examine the formal definition of this model."

The same goes for the decisions themselves, where in many instances you may want to attach a continuous value (e.g., a probability value) to a decision instead of a yes or no label.\n",

    "The McCulloch-Pitts artificial neuron was a significant first step in the development of artificial neural network models of cognition. Interestingly, it lacks two elements that are at the core of modern artificial neural networks: (1) it works with binary inputs and outputs, instead of arbitrary real-valued numbers, and (2) it does not incorporate a learning algorithm, which limits its functionality to problems that can be derived by the modeler. That being said, this model was a remarkable creative achievement to the extent that blended insights from theoretical computer science, logic, neuroscience, and cognitive psychology.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important remaining question is to what extent the McCulloch-Pitts artificial neurons says something substantial about human cognition. Although is true that this model was able to perform logical inference as humans do, it is not clear that the procedure is indeed similar to what is going on in the human mind. Part of the credibility of this approach comes from the fact that it is based on the observed behavior of biological neurons. If you come from the perspective that cognition is whatever the brain is doing, you have a starting point to validate this model. Now, binary threshold functions are an extremely simplified model of what brains do. Is this a good enough model of neurocognitive function? Probably not. As we know today, the behavior of ensembles of neurons is incredibly complex, to the point that it is hard to even conceive a complete model of brain function. That being said, it would be unfair to judge this model against such standards. As we mentioned in the introduction, computational models of cognition do not pretend to be a replica of the mind. From that perspective, it is undeniable that the  McCulloch-Pitts model provided important insights into how to use this approach to better understand human cognition.  "
