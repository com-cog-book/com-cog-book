# How to Use This Book

There are three ways to interact with this book: 

- **Static site**: read as a traditional static website.

- **In-site interaction**: some sections have a `Thebelab`  icon at the top of the page.  By clicking the icon, interactive usage will be enabled within the site. Each code-cell will add a `run` icon at the bottom. If you click the `run` icon, the cell will request a python kernel to run the contents. This may take a minute. 

- **Remote interaction**: some sections have a `Interact via Binder` icon at the top of the page.  By clicking the icon, you will be redirected to [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/), and interactive cloud computing environment. The site will build the environment with the required dependencies, and launch an interactive Jupyter Notebook. This process usually takes 3-5 minutes to complete the *first time*. In subsequent attempts, my binder will reuse the environment previously built to speed up the process. 



**Which interactive environment should I use?** Depends on the content of the section. Lightweight code should work just fine *In-site*. If the section contains a ton of code, you may consider to use the *remote binder environment*. You can also set up everything in your local environment (i.e., your own computer), by following the instructions in the [GitHub repository for the project here](https://github.com/pabloinsente/comp_models_cog_beh)
