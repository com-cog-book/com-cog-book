# About

The goal of this project is to introduce a selection of canonical models in cognitive science. Each section covers the following contents:

- Historical context  
- Theoretical background
- Mathematical definition
- Code implementation  
- Example application  
- Model limitations  

Models are implemented in Python as Jupyter Notebooks tutorials. Although is recommended to follow the tutorials in a linear fashion, these can be used as stand-alone learning material, which comes at the cost of moderate redundancy in both contents and code.

In the first stage of this project, I focus solely on connectionist models of cognition. In future stages, symbolic and probabilistic models may be added to create a more complete introduction to the subject.

The tutorials are intended to be used by novices to intermediate level students and/or researchers in cognitive science or related fields. Knowledge of Python is not required, but it is advised to have previous exposure/experience working with some dynamic programming language like R, Julia, Scala, or Matlab.
